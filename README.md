# MDL Syntax Definition

NVIDIA Material Definition Language (MDL) syntax highlighting for Visual Studio Code. This is a very basic syntax highlighting configuration. Some rules are borrowed from the default C syntax for Sublime Text but will likely be specialised further in the future.

## More Information

For more details on MDL please see the [NVIDIA MDL website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/material-definition-language/) and the [NVIDIA MDL SDK](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MDL-SDK) GitHub repository.
